This is a little Python utility to write banks of data for the ENTTEC DMXIS DMX
lighting controller.  I've tested it with Python 2.6 and Python 2.7.

It provides two services:  it allows you to only specify that values that aren't
defaults, and it also allows you to specify human-readable names and values.


To execute the program, type

  python WriteBank.py yourBank.json

where yourBank.json is a data file that you've created to describe your bank and
its presets.  The data file can be in JSON format, or if you have installed the
Python YAML package PyYAML, the program will also read YAML files.

There are two example data files in this directory, test.json and test.yaml,
which give identical results:  the three files bank.xml, test1.prt and test2.prt.


Please don't hesitate to contact me if you need any help getting this program
set up and I'll incorporate the results into the next version of this document.
